## Install

```bash
npm i -g hunkdiff
```

Or with Homebrew:

```bash
brew install modem-dev/tap/hunk
```

Requirements:

- Node.js 18+
- macOS, Linux, or Windows
- Git recommended for most workflows

> Nix users can use the `default` package exported in `flake.nix` instead. See [nix/README.md](./nix/README.md) for details.

## Quick start

```bash
hunk           # show help
hunk --version # print the installed version
```

### Working with Git

Hunk mirrors Git's diff-style commands, but opens the changeset in a review UI instead of plain text.

```bash
hunk diff                      # review current repo changes, including untracked files
hunk diff --watch              # auto-reload as the working tree changes
hunk show                      # review the latest commit
hunk show HEAD~1               # review an earlier commit
```

### Working with Jujutsu

Hunk auto-detects Jujutsu checkouts, so `hunk diff [revset]` and `hunk show [revset]` use jj revsets inside a jj workspace. To override VCS detection, set `vcs = "git"` or `vcs = "jj"` in [config](#config).

### Working with raw files and patches

```bash
hunk diff before.ts after.ts                # compare two files directly
hunk diff before.ts after.ts --watch        # auto-reload when either file changes
git diff --no-color | hunk patch -          # review a patch from stdin
```

### Working with agents

1. Open Hunk in another terminal with `hunk diff` or `hunk show`.
2. Tell your agent to add the skill file returned by `hunk skill path`.
3. Ask your agent to use the skill against the live Hunk session.

A good generic prompt is:

```text
Load the Hunk skill and use it for this review.
```

For the full live-session and `--agent-context` workflow guide, see [docs/agent-workflows.md](docs/agent-workflows.md).

Hunk is optimized for reviewing a full changeset interactively.

## Advanced

### Config

You can persist preferences to a config file:

- `~/.config/hunk/config.toml`
- `.hunk/config.toml`

Example:

```toml
theme = "graphite"   # graphite, midnight, paper, ember, catppuccin-latte, catppuccin-mocha, night-owl, custom
mode = "auto"        # auto, split, stack
vcs = "git"          # git, jj
watch = false
exclude_untracked = false
line_numbers = true
wrap_lines = false
agent_notes = false
```

`exclude_untracked` affects Git working-tree `hunk diff` sessions only.

Custom themes can inherit from any built-in base theme and override only the colors you care about:

```toml
theme = "custom"

[custom_theme]
base = "graphite"    # graphite, midnight, paper, ember, catppuccin-latte, catppuccin-mocha, night-owl
label = "My Theme"
accent = "#7fd1ff"
panel = "#10161d"
noteBorder = "#c49bff"

[custom_theme.syntax]
keyword = "#8ed4ff"
string = "#c7b4ff"
comment = "#6e85a7"
```

All custom theme colors must use `#rrggbb` hex values.

### Git integration

Set Hunk as your Git pager so `git diff` and `git show` open in Hunk automatically:

> [!NOTE]
> Untracked files are auto-included only for Hunk's own `hunk diff` working-tree loader. If you open `git diff` through `hunk pager`, Git still decides the patch contents, so untracked files will not appear there.

```bash
git config --global core.pager "hunk pager"
```

Or in your Git config:

```ini
[core]
    pager = hunk pager
```

If you want to keep Git's default pager and add opt-in aliases instead:

```bash
git config --global alias.hdiff "-c core.pager=\"hunk pager\" diff"
git config --global alias.hshow "-c core.pager=\"hunk pager\" show"
```

### Jujutsu pager integration

To use Hunk as jj's pager, run `jj config edit --user` and update:

```toml
[ui]
pager = ["hunk", "pager"]
diff-formatter = ":git"
```

### OpenTUI component

Hunk also publishes `HunkDiffView` and lower-level primitives from `hunkdiff/opentui` for embedding the same diff renderer in your own OpenTUI app.

See [docs/opentui-component.md](docs/opentui-component.md) for install, API, and runnable examples.

## Examples

Ready-to-run demo diffs live in [`examples/`](examples/README.md).

Each example includes the exact command to run from the repository root.
